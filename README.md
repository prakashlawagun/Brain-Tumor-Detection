# Brain-Tumor-Detection

Brain tumor detection is a process of identifying the presence of a tumor in the brain using medical imaging techniques. It is an important diagnostic tool that helps in the early detection and treatment of brain tumors. To detect brain tumors in an image, various machine learning algorithms can be used. One of the commonly used algorithms is a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN is trained on a dataset of brain tumor images, which allows it to learn the features that distinguish tumor from healthy brain tissue. Once the CNN is trained, it can be used to classify new brain tumor images as either tumor or healthy tissue. The accuracy of the brain tumor detection model can be measured by evaluating its performance on a test dataset. An accuracy of 95% means that the model correctly identified 95% of the brain tumor images in the test dataset. It is important to note that the accuracy of the brain tumor detection model can vary depending on various factors such as the quality of the input image, the size of the dataset used for training, and the complexity of the algorithm used. Therefore, it is important to use a large and diverse dataset for training the model and to regularly evaluate its performance to ensure its accuracy.
